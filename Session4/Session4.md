# Activities and Our Home

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand how last session went, was everyone able to do homework? Revise body parts.
2. We will revisit sentence formation by discussing physical activities and writing them down.
3. We will do a group conversation to see how everyone imagines a typical Bangalore home.

## Plan
1.  Greetings (5 mins)
2.  Homework Feedback
- Apart from Mintu, no one was able to complete their homework. They insisted it wasn't difficult, but that they hadn't 	found the time (they assumed they had another week to do it or were otherwise occupied).
3.  Revision (20 minutes)
- Repeat the exercises naming each body part as we get to it
4.  Physical activity (30-45 mins)
- Talk about what each body part is used for (eyes for seeing, hands for working, legs for walking) that leads into other activities that one can do
- As last week, have everyone stand up in their places giving space for free movement
- For each activity, have everyone emulate that activity together
- For each activity, do some variations which highlight dichotomies using adverbs (helping with vocabulary where required):
      - talking loudly/softly, running quickly/slowly
- Play a game of dumb charades where one person acts and the others guess the name of an activity and then spell it out on the board
5.  Group Conversation (30-45 mins)
- Form a group all sitting facing each other. Clear monitors off tables if requried.
- One by one, discuss the following:
  	- Describe a room in your house
  	- Something that you leave the house with, and something that you bring back 
  		- (ex. leave with money, bring back groceries, leave with a bag, buy a pen
      	- Name one object from each room of the house
