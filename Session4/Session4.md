# Activities and Our Home

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand how last session went, was everyone able to do homework? Revise body parts.
2. We will revisit sentence formation by discussing physical activities and writing them down.
3. We will do a group conversation to see how everyone imagines a typical Bangalore home.

## Plan
1.	Greetings (5 mins)
2.	Homework Feedback (15-20 mins)
	-	Review homework and discuss how was their experience doing it. Did they enjoyed writing?
  - Discuss whether they are still calling Sir or Ma'am, if yes then why?
    - Reiterate that people deserve respect not due to their posts, roles, or titles in life... but how they act. Give examples.
3.  Physical activity (30-45 mins)
  - Talk about a physical activity each person does (walking, running, trekking, cooking, cycling, cricket, swimming, etc.)
    - As last week, have everyone stand up in their places giving space for free movement
    - For each activity, have everyone emulate that activity together.
    - For each activity, do some variations which highlight dichotomies (helping with vocabulary where required):
      - fast/slow walking, trekking up/downhill, swimming on the front/back, etc.
4.  Group Conversation (30-45 mins)
  - Form a group all sitting facing each other. Clear monitors off tables if requried.
  - One by one, discuss the following:
    - The common household:
      - One element of common household input and output (things which enter/leave the house daily, other than people):
        - groceries, electricity, gas, wash water, water cans, sewage, garbage
      - One utensil or tool used in preparing food
      - One item used in the bath
      - One item used to sleep
    - Transportation
      - How does everyone get to the office?
5.  Let's draw our house... or maybe one room in our house, depending on time? (20-30 mins)
  - Draw a picture of your house. Suggestions can be from the above discussion or suggest a specific room: bedroom, hall, kitchen, balcony.

## Homework
