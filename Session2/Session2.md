# Face Parts

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand how last session went, was everyone able to do homework?
2. Discuss about Sir and Ma'am and explain how friendship, equality and diversity is more important and removing usage of these words will strengthen our bond.
3. We will learn basics about sentence formation through face parts and will gradully dive into talking about Human Body in coming sessions, so try to set the foundation well. 
4. Learn to write basic face parts

## Plan 
1.	Greetings (5 mins) 
2.	Discuss CAFE attributes about other co-employees (Homework Feedback - 15-20 mins) 
3.	Discuss about Sir & Ma'am (30 mins)
	- Let's draw two stick figures on board, facing each other as if they are communicating.  
	- Create a callout with 'Sir' inside it, coming from one figure and slightly elevate other figure so that it feels like it is standing on a platform
	- Discuss what this platform represents to them, ask questions why they call you Sir/Ma'am? Note down all the reasons they mention on board
	- Talk about why you respect and admire them and then elevate the other creature too and keep on doing this activity, until both figures have been elevated quite above the ground
	- Then ask do we seriously need these huge platforms? Talk about friendship and equality why it is far more important then these imaginary platforms
	- Next talk about diversity by giving traditional examples like fingers of a hand, etc.       
4.	Let's talk about our Face (45 - 60 mins)
	-	Write all face parts on the left side of the board
	-	Write all verbs related to these face parts on right in jumbled order (Eye: See, Blink, etc | Nose: Breathe, Smell, etc)
	-	Ask each person to map a body to the correct verb. Repeat until all body parts are mapped correctly to all the verbs
	-	Basic sentence formation around these body parts and associated verbs - Making it slightly funny (I have a big nose and I like to smell tea)	
	- 	We will now indulge into drawing our own or friend's face on a sheet with help of crayons and sketch pens
	- 	We will end the class by discussing about our first working sheet as Homework  		

## Homework
Simple writing sheet to practice writing these discussed face parts post the class. Half of the blocks contains dotted characters so that they get familiar to structure of each alphabet and latter half are empty so that they can replicate it without dots.
