# Body Parts and Conversation about City

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand how last session went, was everyone able to do homework? Revise face parts 
2. We will learn basics about sentence formation through body parts and learn to write basic body parts.
3. Next we will do our first group conversation today and try to understand how everyone see the city

## Plan 
1.	Greetings (5 mins) 
2.	Homework Feedback(15-20 mins) 
	-	Review homework and discuss how was their experience doing it. Did they enjoyed writing? Discuss whether they are still calling Sir or Ma'am, if yes then why? 
3.	Body parts(30-45 mins)
	- 	Talk about several body parts and jot these down on Whiteboard. 
	-	Then let's do our first activity involving some physical excersise. Ask everyone to stand up in their places giving some space for free movement.
	- 	Now point out a body part, ask its name. And then ask everyone to rotate it.
	-	Infuse some fun moments, do some variations with speed. Let them enjoy this activity.
4.	Group Conversation (30-45 mins)
	-	Let's form a group all sitting in a way facing each other
	-	One by one we will discuss following topics:
		-	Family, Friends
		- 	Home town
		- 	Office
		-	Now slightly shifting focus to Bangalore
		- 	What you like about the city?
		- 	Dislikes about the city?
		- 	Given a special power, what one thing you would like to change here? How?

5.	Let's draw our city (20-30 mins)
	-	Draw a picture representing Bangalore in its true form. Suggestions can be derived from above discussion or one can give ideas around traffic jam, trees and crowd in contrast, BMTC buses and metro, etc.

## Homework
Simple writing sheet to practice writing these discussed body parts post the class. Half of the blocks contains dotted characters so that they get familiar to structure of each alphabet and latter half are empty so that they can replicate it without dots.
