# Grammar (and zoos!)

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand how last session went:
   - was everyone able to do homework?
   - how many times did everyone read with their reading buddy?
2. Quickly revisit nutrition
3. We will dive into constructing basic sentences
4. We will start our second reading comprehension

## Plan 
1.	Greetings (5 mins) 
2.	Homework Feedback (10-15 mins) 
	- Review homework and discuss how was their experience doing it. Did they enjoy reading with partners? 
3.  Revise nutrition facts (10-15 mins)
4.	Review word categories (5-10 mins)
	- Assuming everyone is at least somewhat familiar with the different word categories, quickly run through them to see if anyone is uncomfortable or unfamiliar with any of them. Where a category is unfamiliar, have the students come up with a few extra examples.
	  - Social words (such as byebye, hi)
	  - Requesting words (such as please, more, again)
	  - Verbs/action words (such as go, eat, sleep, drink, jump, open, push)
	  - Early pronouns (such as me, mine, my, I, you)
	  - Prepositions/location words (such as in, out, off, on, up, down, here, there)
	  - Negation (such as no and then later contractions including don’t, can’t)
	  - Adjectives & adverbs/descriptive words (such as big, hot, fast, yucky)
4.	Introduction to sentence structure (60-90 mins)
	- introduce: [subject + verb + object] with examples from previous lessons:
	  - colours / activities / fruits / food
	  - parts of the face
	  - parts of the body
	  - hometown, office, the city
	  - activities with parts of the body
	  - our home
	  - hygiene
	  - disease (Dengue, or other seasonally/geographically relevant ailments)
	  - nutrition
	- introduce tenses: [subject + VERB + object] with examples from previous lessons
	- introduce prepositional phrases: [subject + verb + object + PHRASE]
	- (optionally) introduce adjectives: [ADJECTIVE + subject + verb + ADJECTIVE + object]
5.	Group conversation (30 mins)
	- "What do you think of zoos?"
	  - allow each person to respond, correcting sentence structure
	- If there is time, start reading the "Are zoos a good thing?" article:
