# Fun English Classes
Documentation about running a fun English class for adults!

The intention of this project is to create a framework for teaching English without the painful and boring language class style so common in corporate "Learn English" settings and curriculums. The goals span a range:

- Abstract: Confidence, Creativity, Curiosity

- Medium: Understanding the behaviour / design spectrum
  - everything which affects our senses is also how we interact with society
  - "behaviour" encompasses our day-to-day choices: safety, conversation, interaction, culture, emotion
  - "design" encompasses the things we create and the space we live in: colour, light, shape, sound/acoustics, food, smells, textures, cohesion, wholes & parts

- Concrete: Daily practices, valuable to the individual and society: 
  - Diet
  - Sleep patterns
  - Waste management (food compost, garden compost, e-waste, paper/plastic/glass/metal recycling)
  - Community resources (libraries, schools, parks)
  - Safe and clean modes of transportation

The ultimate intention is for the students to learn English and further their careers. However, the continuous goal would be to ensure students never feel that's what they are striving toward.
